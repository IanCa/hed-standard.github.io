description: "The HED-SCORE library schema is the first extension of the <a href='https://www.hedtags.org/display_hed.html'>base schema</a> of the <a href='https://hedtags.org/'>Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED)</a> system for describing events occurring during neuroimaging time series recordings. The HED-SCORE schema allows neurologists, neurophysiologists, and brain researchers to annotate electrophysiology recordings using terms from an internationally accepted set of defined terms, the Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE)1,2.<br>SCORE1 is a standard terminology for EEG data assessment designed for use in clinical practice that may also be used for research purposes. The SCORE standard received European consensus, and has been endorsed by the European Chapter of the IFCN and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission on European Affairs. A second revised and extended version of SCORE2 achieved international consensus.<br>The SCORE standard defines terms for describing phenomena observed in scalp EEG data. It is also potentially applicable (with some suitable extensions) to EEG recorded in critical care and neonatal settings. Future extensions may be implemented in the HED-SCORE library schema.
