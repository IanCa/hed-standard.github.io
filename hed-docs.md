# HED documentation and other information

This page contains links to various publications and guides for HED tagging. 
HED has undergone two major transformations from its original form. HEG-(3G)
is the latest version and is in the process of being fully released. Users are
**strongly** encouraged to transition to HED-(3G).  

## HED-(3G) 
HED-(3G) has a redesigned and streamlined vocabulary for ease of use. The 
individual terms in the HED-(3G) are unique, so annotators can use single
terms rather than full paths. HED-(3G) allows library schema for specialized 
vocabularies and supports infrastructure for capturing experimental design
and event-context in a machine-actionable form. HED-(3G) corresponds to HED
versions 8.0.0-alpha.1 and above.

## HED-(2G)
HED-(2G) replaced a single vocabulary hierarchy with orthogonal subtrees, 
significantly reducing duplication of terms within the hierarchy. HED-(2G) also
introduced parentheses and a significant tool base including online validation. 
HED-(2G) includes HED versions between 4.x.x and 7.x.x.

# HED-(1G)
HED-(1G) is the original incarnation of hierarchical event descriptors based on CogPO.
HED-(1G), which includes HED versions less than 4.0.0, is no longer supported. However,
the [headIT repository](https://headit.ucsd/edu) contains 13 publicly available EEG studies
that have been annotated using HED-(1G).
